### CHIKU PARIDA

I am a doctoral researcher at [DTU Energy](https://www.energy.dtu.dk/){:target="_blank"}, where I am working on the inverse design of solid electrolytes for solid-state batteries (for more information, please see my research section). [Prof. Juan Maria Garc√≠a Lastra](https://orbit.dtu.dk/en/persons/juan-maria-garc%C3%ADa-lastra){:target="_blank"} and [Dr. Arghya Bhowmik](https://orbit.dtu.dk/en/persons/arghya-bhowmik){:target="_blank"} are the project supervisors at DTU Energy. This project is associated with the [University of Queensland](https://aibn.uq.edu.au/){:target="_blank"}. [Prof. Debra Bernhardt](https://aibn.uq.edu.au/bernhardt){:target="_blank"} from the University of Queensland is our collaborator. She is co-supervising the project and supporting my external stay in Australia.
